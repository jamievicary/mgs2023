<h1>Computational Models of Higher Categories</h1>
<h2><a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/events/MGS23/">Midland Graduate School 2023</a></h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Directed higher category theory is a powerful and expressive area of mathematics, with a range of applications across computer science and physics. Computational techniques give an excellent way to learn this subject in a hands-on way that avoids much of the complexity of traditional mathematical approaches.</p>
<p>In this mini-course we will focus on two proof assistants, <a href="https://github.com/ericfinster/catt.io">Catt</a> and <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy.io">homotopy.io</a>, which use very different techniques to allow us to define and compose cells in finitely-generated <i>n</i>-categories.</p>
<h3>Proof assistants</h3>
<ul>

	<li>The homotopy.io proof assistant: <a href="https://beta.homotopy.io">beta.homotopy.io</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Course materials</h3>
<p>The course notes will be available for download soon.</p>
